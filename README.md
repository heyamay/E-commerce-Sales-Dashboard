ðŸ“Œ Sharing My Power BI Skills with an E-commerce Sales Dashboard! ðŸ“Š

I'm happy to share an interactive dashboard I made to track and analyze online sales for a particular Store across India.

Objective: The owner of the Store wanted a tool to keep an eye on their sales and understand how the business is doing. I created this dashboard using Power BI to help them do just that.

Key Highlights:

ðŸ¥‡ Added filters and slicers to let users explore the data in detail.

ðŸ¥ˆ Connected different tables, did calculations, and set up user-driven options to make the visuals more informative.

ðŸ¥‰ Used different charts, like bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, and more, to make the data easy to understand.

This dashboard shows how data can be turned into useful insights. It helps in tracking profit and loss, understanding which products are selling best, and learning about customer behavior.

I'm proud of what I've achieved with this project and look forward to applying this level of data analysis to future projects!
