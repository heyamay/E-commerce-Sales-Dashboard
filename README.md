I'm happy to share an interactive dashboard I made to track and analyze online sales for a particular Store across India.

Objective: The owner of the Store wanted a tool to keep an eye on their sales and understand how the business is doing. I created this dashboard using Power BI to help them do just that.

Key Highlights:

ðŸ¥‡ Added filters and slicers to let users explore the data in detail.

ðŸ¥ˆ Connected different tables, did calculations, and set up user-driven options to make the visuals more informative.

ðŸ¥‰ Used different charts, like bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, and more, to make the data easy to understand.

This dashboard shows how data can be turned into useful insights. It helps in tracking profit and loss, understanding which products are selling best, and learning about customer behavior.

Key Features:

- Total Sales & Profit Analysis: Tracked the sum of sales amount (438K) and total profit (37K) to monitor overall business performance.  

- Top Regions & Customers: Visualized the top contributing states (Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh) and highest-spending customers to identify target areas.  

- Category-Wise Sales Breakdown: Showcased product sales distribution, with Clothing accounting for 63% of sales, followed by Electronics and Furniture.  

- Profit-Loss Trends: Monthly profit-loss tracking for each quarter, identifying critical periods of growth and downturns.  

- Payment Methods: Analyzed customer preferences, with Cash on Delivery (44%) being the dominant payment method, followed by UPI and Debit/Credit cards.

- Sub-Category Profit Analysis: Examined profits by sub-categories like Printers, Bookcases, Sarees, and Accessories to focus on high-profit areas.

Tools Used:

- Power BI for interactive data visualization and insights.
- Data Sources: CSV files and sales records for historical performance data.

I'm proud of what I've achieved with this project and look forward to applying this level of data analysis to future projects!
